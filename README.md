# python_on_steroids_with_Numba

Alot of people are complaining about how slow python is.

So is Python really that slow?

Short answer: yes

But wait! Do you know that python has a compiler! Yes a JIT (just in time) compiler;  Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.

And The following will show how awesome python is :D 

The Following are results of calculating the square root up to 100000000 numbers.

# Conclusion
It's Clear that python with Numba are the champions.

And look how great Numba is, Look how slow python without it.
